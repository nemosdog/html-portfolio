<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
  I'm Filip and I'm a UX designer undercover front-end developer. I am a person with a lot of hobbies and interests <br>
  that I usually do all at the same time. I am an ambitious reader, if you don't trust me then just visit my Goodreads <br>
  page and be amazed at the pace that I add new books.But apart from a good book I like red wine, long hikes and to <br>
  paint. If this doesn't hook you then that's probably because you haven'tmet me yet so therefore I challenge you to <br>
  contact me so that we might be able to mend that. I'm alwaysopen for a cup of java or even better, a glass of wine.
