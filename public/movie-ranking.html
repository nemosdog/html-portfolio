    <h2>Some of my favorite movie experiences from 2023</h2>

        <h3>After Yang</h3>
        <p> 
        This is by far my top pick from 2023, a movie where I got to see Collin Ferrell play a very caring father and woke thoughts on how the future could look like for homo technologicus.

        <h3>Akira</h3>
        <p>
        This anime has been on my list for a long time. A gorgeous film with an amazing music score that echoes in my bones to this day, even though I saw it nine moths ago.
        </p>       
        <h3>Call me by your name</h3>
        <p>
        This too has been on my list for a long time. Till I saw this movie, I cant say that I ever have been so invested in a gay coming of age story. The love and respect of Elios father Mr. Pearlman just melted my heart.
        This will be a movie that I vill rewatch again and agian, just to be able to experience that fealthy family relationship between Elio and his parents once more.
